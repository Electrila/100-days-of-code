## :calendar: Day 1/100 - Tuesday, February 18, 2020
**Today's Progress**
<br>
I finished and uploaded the [HTML](https://github.com/Electrila/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Tea%20Cozy/index.html) and [CSS](https://github.com/Electrila/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Tea%20Cozy/style.css) for a recreation of the homepage for a fictional company called Tea Cozy :tea: and everything looks pretty close to the [design spec](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/freelance-1/unit-4/img-tea-cozy-redline.jpg)! And the best part? IT'S (somewhat) FUNCTIONAL!
<br>
<br>
**Thoughts**  :thought_balloon:
<br>
Feeling pretty good about my first HTML/CSS attempt.  I've only extensively studied [Python](https://www.python.org/) up until this point and I'm enjoying checking out some new languages.
<br>
<br>
## :calendar: Day 2/100 - Wednesday, February 19, 2020
**Today's Progress**
<br>
I didn't have time to work on any coding projects, but I grabbed a copy of [*Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++*](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Principles-Practice-Using-C-ebook/dp/B00KPTEH8C) by the man himself, [Bjarne Stroustrup](http://www.stroustrup.com/) and got through Chapter 1: Computers, People, and Programming.
<br>
<br>
**Thoughts**  :thought_balloon:
<br>
I have done a little hands-on practice with C++ through [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/) and [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus).  After skimming through this book, I have a feeling it's going to be a great help.  C++ is the main language I'm interested in, since it [has a ton of applications](http://www.stroustrup.com/applications.html).  I'm looking forward to digging into the book a bit more.
<br>
<br>
## :calendar: Day 3/100 - Thursday, February 20, 2020
**Today's Progress**
<br>
I finished the Responsive Web Design track on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) and am ready to begin the 'Projects' section tomorrow.
<br>
<br>
**Thoughts**  :thought_balloon:
<br>
I have enjoyed learning HTML and CSS elements, but am feeling a little overwhelmed by the sheer amount of customizations available within CSS.  I am looking forward to beginning the projects though and hopefully the practice will give me the opportunity to experiment with various elements.
<br>
<br>
## :calendar: Day 4/100 - Friday, February 21, 2020
**Today's Progress**
<br>
I uploaded basic [HTML](https://github.com/Electrila/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Tribute%20Page/index.html) for a Tribute Page I'm doing as part of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design curriculum.  I have gone beyond what the requirements call for, as I really want to see what I'm able to produce with everything I've learned so far.
<br>
<br>
**Thoughts**  :thought_balloon:
<br>
Thinking about beginning the CSS for this project is a little overwhelming.  I have a pretty good idea of what I want the final product to look like, now I just need to figure out how to translate that into working CSS.  I'm going to take a break for today, maybe read another chapter in *Programming: Principles and Practice using C++*.  I may come back to this project later if the mood strikes me.
<br>
<br>
## :calendar: Day 5/100 - Saturday, February 22, 2020
**Today's Progress**
<br>
I struggled with the CSS for my Tribute Page today.  The sheer amount of ways you can format elements is somewhat mind-boggling and it definitely is intimidating and hard to know where to start.  Instead of just getting frustrated and quitting for the day, I spent time going through [MDN Web Docs CSS tutorials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) and browsing [Stack Overflow forums](https://stackoverflow.com).  I also did a little work on [Codecademy's CSS path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css), completed all paths on [Grasshopper](https://learn.grasshopper.app/) (which included some CSS elements as well), did a few Python challenges on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard), started the Python track on [DataCamp](https://learn.datacamp.com/) to continue refining my skills, and began the Web Development 101 program on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard).  If I'm not making progress on projects, at least I'm keeping up with my learning!
<br>
<br>
**Thoughts**  :thought_balloon:
<br>
So [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) are AMAZING.  There is a wealth of information for all kinds of languages, along with predefined tutorials for beginners.  Additionally, I am enjoying [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard) so far.  The challenges really make you think and I love that there are no set requirements for how the challenges must be complete.  As long as you pass the tests, your code will pass, but there is allotted time to refactor your code before making your final submission, which allows you to come up with more efficient solutions once you pass the requirements.
<br>

## :calendar: Day 6/100 - Sunday, February 23, 2020
**Today's Progress**
<br>
I checked out computer science and programming courses on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org), and [edX](https://www.edx.org/).  Utimately, I ended up signing up for four classes through edX: HTML5 & CSS Fundamentals, Advanced CSS, Programming for the Web with JavaScript, and Introduction to C++.
<br>
<br>
**Thoughts**  :thought_balloon:
<br>
A lot of the websites I listed offer certificates of completion for their courses, but at a cost.  There are also skill paths that include several courses with a certificate of completion at the end as well.  These could be useful to help me get into an entry-level position until I'm able to start working on a B.S. in Computer Science.  Each site offers a TON of courses, along with projects to complete that can be added to a personal portfolio.  I also think taking the C++ course as I'm reading through *Programming: Principles and Practice using C++* will be helpful.  I'm a hands-on learner so if I'm able to practice the concepts as I'm reading about them, I'll probably be more inclined to understand and remember what I'm learning.
<br>

## :calendar: Day 7/100 - Monday, February 24, 2020
**Today's Progress**
<br>
I began learning how to draw shapes with JavaScript through a course on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org).  I created a [drawing](https://github.com/Electrila/100-days-of-code/blob/master/JS%20Drawings/dinner.js) of a dinner plate with steak, a baked potato with butter, and peas.  I am going to continue working through the course today and plan to upload any other projects I end up creating.
<br>
<br>
**Thoughts**  :thought_balloon:
<br>
Drawing with code is pretty fun so far.  Although the drawing I made was created with only two or three different shapes, I had a lot of fun doing it and experimenting.  I'm looking forward to learning some more and hopefully will be able to create more complex drawings in the future and learn how to do it more efficiently.  Drawing all those peas individually was insane!
