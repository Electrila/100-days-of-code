# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1/100 - Tuesday, February 18, 2020
#####
**Today's Progress**
<br>
Uploaded basic HTML outline for recreation of the homepage for a fictional company called 'Tea Cozy'.
<br>
Update: Finished HTML and CSS and everything looks pretty close to the design spec! And the best part? IT'S FUNCTIONAL! (if only basic!)
<br>
<br>
**Thoughts**
<br>
Feeling pretty good about my first HTML/CSS attempt.  I've only studied Python extensively up until this and I'm enjoying checking out some new languages.
<br>
<br>
### Day 2/100 - Wednesday, February 19, 2020
#####
**Today's Progress**
<br>
Didn't have time to work on any coding projects, but I grabbed a copy of 'Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++' by Bjarne Stroustrup.  I got through Chapter 1: Computers, People, and Programming.
<br>
<br>
**Thoughts**
<br>
I've done a little hands-on practice with C++ (SoloLearn and Codecademy mainly) and from skimming through this book, I have a feeling it's going to be a great help.  C++ is the main language I'm interested in, since it has a ton of applications.  I'm looking forward to digging into the book a bit more.

### Day 3/100 - Thursday, February 20, 2020
#####
**Today's Progress**
<br>
I finished the Responsive Web Design track on freeCodeCamp and am ready to begin the 'Projects' section tomorrow.
<br>
<br>
**Thoughts**
<br>
I've enjoyed learning HTML and CSS elements, but am feeling a little overwhelmed by the sheer amount of customizations available within CSS.  I am looking forward to beginning the projects though and hopefully the practice will give me the opportunity to experiment with various elements.

### Day 4/100 - Friday, February 21, 2020
#####
**Today's Progress**
<br>
Uploaded a basic HTML outline of a Tribute Page I'm doing as part of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design curriculum.  I have gone beyond what the requirements call for, as I really want to see what I'm able to produce with everything I've learned so far.
<br>
<br>
**Thoughts**
<br>
Thinking about beginning the CSS for this project is a little overwhelming.  I have a pretty good idea of what I want the final product to look like, now I just need to figure out how to translate that into working CSS.  I'm going to take a break for today, maybe read another chapter in 'Programming: Principles and Practice using C++'.  I may come back to this later if the mood strikes me.
