**Today's Progress**
<br>
Working on easing myself back into the coding mindset again. I completed [Python From Beginner to Intermediate in 30 Mins](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-from-beginner-to-expert-starter-free/) on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/). The coding exercises I completed can be found [here](https://github.com/Electrila/100-days-of-code/tree/master/Python%20From%20Beginner%20to%20Intermediate). The course was super simple, but taking just one week off from coding made me a little rusty as a beginner.

**Thoughts**  :thought_balloon:
<br>
It's actually quite surprising how much you can forget when not coding daily, especially when your mental energy is focused on other things. I'm a little less confident in my abilities, but looking back on past projects I've done makes me feel a bit better and gives me motivation towards exceeding that level.
