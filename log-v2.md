**Today's Progress**
<br>
Working on easing myself back into the coding mindset again. I completed [Python From Beginner to Intermediate in 30 Mins](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-from-beginner-to-expert-starter-free/) on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/). The coding exercises I completed can be found [here](https://github.com/Electrila/100-days-of-code/tree/master/Python%20From%20Beginner%20to%20Intermediate). The course was super simple, but taking just one week off from coding made me a little rusty as a beginner.

<br>
<br>
**Thoughts**  :thought_balloon:
<br>
It's actually quite surprising how much you can forget when not coding daily, especially when your mental energy is focused on other things. I'm a little less confident in my abilities, but looking back on past projects I've done makes me feel a bit better and gives me motivation towards exceeding that level.

**Today's Progress**
<br>
Read another chapter in [Bjarne Stroustrup's](http://www.stroustrup.com) [Programming Principles & Practice Using C++](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Principles-Practice-Using-2nd/dp/0321992784). Starting to get to the good stuff!

<br>
<br>
**Thoughts**  :thought_balloon:
<br>
I'm finally getting to the sections where I'm able to follow along with coding in the book and work on syntax again. I haven't messed around with C++ lately, so this will be good practice. I'm very interested in C++ applications for robotics and manufacturing. Additionally, I'd really like to start getting into [PLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller) coding and start learning languages like [Ladder Diagram (Ladder Logic)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladder_logic) and [Function Block Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_block_diagram).

## :calendar: Day 3/100 - Sunday, March 15, 2020
**Today's Progress**
<br>
I began working on another [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) course, [C++ Tutorial For Complete Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/free-learn-c-tutorial-beginners/). I set up a [MinGW Compiler](http://www.mingw.org/) as well as [Eclipse IDE/CDT Development tools](https://www.eclipse.org/cdt/) and PATH environment variables and aliases so I'm able to begin writing source code and compiling on Windows.

<br>
<br>
**Thoughts**  :thought_balloon:
<br>
Setting up the compiler and IDE was a little challenging, but [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) always has some great resources to help. Looking at a few tutorials, I was able to set everything up and verify it was working correctly. As I progress through my book and course, I'll be able to code along to get some experience.

## :calendar: Day 4/100 - Monday, March 16, 2020
**Today's Progress**
<br>
I continued working through [Udemy's](https://www.udemy.com/) course, [C++ Tutorial For Complete Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/free-learn-c-tutorial-beginners/). I began learning about OOP and inheritance, which can prove very useful when writing functional programs.
<br>
<br>
**Thoughts**  :thought_balloon:
<br>
I studied OOP in Python for a bit, so thankfully I have a basic understanding of the theory behind it. I'm excited to see how I can implement it within C++ programs.
<br>

## :calendar: Day 5/100 - Tuesday, March 17, 2020
**Today's Progress**
<br>
I continued [Udemy's](https://www.udemy.com/) course, [C++ Tutorial For Complete Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/free-learn-c-tutorial-beginners/), and started learning about pointers.
<br>
<br>
**Thoughts**  :thought_balloon:
<br>
Okay, so pointers are a bit confusing to me. I only briefly studied them in Python, so I plan to find some [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) videos that will help explain them. I really want to finish [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Responsive Web Design Certification, but I'm struggling a bit with flexboxes and mobile settings, which is preventing me from finishing my projects. I found a few [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) classes that are dedicated to flexboxes, so I'm planning on working through those so I'm able to implement what I learned in my projects, particularly my [Tribute Page](https://github.com/Electrila/100-days-of-code/tree/master/Tribute%20Page).
