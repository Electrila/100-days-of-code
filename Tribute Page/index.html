      <!-- Early Life -->
      <section>
        <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <p>Darrell Lance Abbott was born on August 20, 1966 in Ennis, Texas. He began playing guitar when he was just twelve years old. His first guitar was a Les Paul-style Hondo with a Pignose amp. His early influences were Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Kiss, and Van Halen. He entered his first guitar competition in Dallas, Texas at age fourteen and won. Dean Zelinsky, founder of Dean Guitars, noted that Abbott "blew everyone away." He went on to win several other guitar competitions in the area.</p>

      <!-- Pantera -->
      <section>
        <h2>Pantera</h2>
          <p>In 1981, Darrell joined Pantera, a band formed by several of his high school classmates. He adopted the stage-name "Diamond Darrell", a reference to the Kiss song "Black Diamond".</p>
          <p>Pantera originally had a glam metal style, mirrored after Kiss, Van Halen, and Judas Priest. Their first album, <em>Metal Magic</em>, was released in 1983, when Abbott was just 16 years old.</p>
          <p>After releasing <em>Projects in the Jungle</em> and <em>I Am the Night</em> in 1984 and 1985 respectively, Pantera began to develop a heavier metal sound. Abbott was particularly influenced by Metallica during this time in his career. <em>Power Metal</em> was released in 1988, which featured Abbott's "speedy riffs", one of the early defining elements of the band.</p>
          <p><em>Cowboys From Hell</em> was released in 1990, and marked the development of the band's signature sound, which was centered around Abbott's guitar playing. <em>Cowboys From Hell</em> became the "blueprint" for groove metal, which was a sub-genre of thrash metal.</p>
          <p>Pantera toured for nearly two years and played approximately 200 shows after the release of <em>Cowboys From Hell</em>. The release of <em>Vulgar Display of Power</em> in 1992 redefined Pantera's groove metal style, along with Abbott's personal style. Feeling that "Diamond Darrell" no longer suited his image or playing style, Abbott adopted the stage-name "Dimebag Darrell" instead, a reference to his refusal to accept more than a dime bag of cannabis at one time.</p>
          <p><em>Far Beyond Driven</em> was released in 1994 and debuted at No. 1 on the <em>Billboard 200</em>. The album was described as "the heaviest album to ever debut at No. 1." Following the release, tensions in the band begin to rise as lead-singer Phil Anselmo began to isolate himself while consuming heavy amounts of alcohol, pain killers, and heroin to treat chronic back pain. <em>The Great Southern Trendkill</em> recordings were held separately, with Anselmo recording vocals at Nothing Studios in New Orleans, while the rest of the band recorded at Chasin' Jason Studio, which was a barn constructed in Abbott's backyard. The album was released in 1996.</p>

          <p>Recording for <em>Reinventing the Steel</em> was difficult as the rift between the band had widened. The album was eventually released in 2000 and peaked at No. 4 on the <em>Billboard 200</em>. The band was scheduled to begin a tour on September 11, 2001, but it was canceled because of the September 11 attacks. The band decided to take a short hiatus, but never got back together. The separation of the band was marked by the release of a greatest hits album, <em>The Best of Pantera: Far Beyond the Great Southern Cowboys' Vulgar Hits!</em> on September 23, 2003.</p>

        <h2>Music Style</h2>
          <p>Originally developing a glam metal style, Abbott was eventually a driving force behind the development of groove metal in the 1990s. Abbott was inspired to play guitar by Ace Frehley of Kiss. Later influencers include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Eddie Van Halen - Van Halen</li>
            <li>Randy Rhoads - Quiet Riot & Ozzy Osbourne</li>
            <li>Tony Iommi - Black Sabbath</li>
            <li>Pete Willis - Def Leppard</li>
            <li>Billy Gibbons - ZZ Top</li>
            <li>Kerry King - Slayer</li>
            <li>James Hetfield - Metallica</li>
            <li>Zakk Wylde - Ozzy Osbourne & Black Label Society</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Abbott's never received formal guitar lessons. He stated in a 1994 Guitar World interview that he once received "a guitar lesson off this cat. He wrote down some weird scale and tried to explain how it worked. After we finished he said, 'Now go on home, practice that scale, and show me how well you can play it next week.' So I took it home, played around with it for a few minutes and said, 'Fuck this, I just want to jam.' I respect people that can read tablature and all that shit, but I just don't even have the patience to read the newspaper."</p>
          <p>Abbott made extensive use of the major third in his riffs and leads, which was a Van Halen-inspired technique. Although he had exceptional picking ability, he favored legato phrasing, which gave his playing a fluid quality. He used techniques such as sliding, bending, palm muting, whammy bars, and effects pedals.</p>
          <p>One of Abbott's most distinctive features was his use of harmonics to make a squealing sound, which was inspired by Gibbons. He also experimented with alternate tunings. Three of Abbott's solos were ranked in <em>Guitar World's</em> "100 Greatest Guitar Solos of All Time":</p>
          <ol>
            <li>"Walk" - No. 57</li>
            <li>"Cemetery Gates - No. 35</li>
            <li>"Floods" - No. 19</li>
          </ol>

      <!-- Death and Legacy -->
      <section>
        <h2>Death & Legacy</h2>
          <p>After Pantera disbanded in 2003, Abbott formed the band Damageplan. While playing a show at the Alrosa Villa nightclub in Columbus, Ohio on December 8, 2004, a deranged fan, Nathan Gale, stormed the stage and shot Abbott multiple times with a 9mm semi-automatic pistol. Abbott was pronounced dead at the scene at age 38. Thousands of fans attended his public memorial, along with artists such as Eddie Van Halen, Zakk Wylde, Corey Taylor, Jerry Cantrell, and Dino Cazares.</p>
          <p>Abbott was posthumously inducted into Hollywood's RockWalk on May 17, 2007. Ace Frehley spoke in honor of Abbott and went on to dedicate his 2009 album <em>Anomaly</em> to Abbott, as well as former Kiss drummer Eric Carr. Abbott was ranked as the most influential metal guitarist of the past 25 years by VH1 in 2015. He was also placed at No. 5 on Gibson's list of "The Top 10 Metal Guitarists of All Time".</p>
          <p>A concert in memory of Abbott titled 'Dimebash' has been held annually since 2010. All proceeds from the concert go towards the Ronnie James Dio 'Stand Up and Shout Cancer Fund'. Past performers have included Dave Grohl, Kerry King, Robb Flynn, Tom Morello, and Serj Tankian.</p>
